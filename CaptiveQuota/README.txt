Captive Quota is a game where you are a mage that has taken some captives for your ritual you are going to cast.
You had placed these 15 captives in a cell (red floor), but you are not smart, and the cell does not have bars to keep them in.
So quite obviously the captives have left the cell and are now trying to escape your dungeon! You need 8 sacrifices for your 
ritual, and luckily for you these sacrifices don't need to be alive, so you just need to make sure at most only 7 captives escape 
so you can do the ritual. Why didn't you kill them instead of locking them up? I already told you, you are not smart at all.
The captives can escape by two different methods, by going to a key mold and getting a key to the exit, or by activating all 3
levers around your dungeon to activate the portal in the magic vault(blue floor). Your only chance of completing your ritual is
by using your trusty and only spell fireball to do the job, again you would know more spells if you were smart.


Controls
WASD for movement
Left click to cast fireball
Right click to turn off an activated lever
F to toggle free cam (not intended for gameplay but for debugging and observing the AI)


Warning:
There is no sound for a captive leaving by a portal or obtaining a key so you don't know when that happens.
